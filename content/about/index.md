### A word about Pepe

The section could have also been phrased "Disclaimer", but I found it valuable to lose a couple of words about Pepe.
As a person roaming the internet, you are probably aware of the fact that Pepe the Frog was abused for political agenda in the mid 2010s.

Yet, Pepe is way older than that.
He originates from a comic called "Boy's Club", created in 2005 by Matt Furie (Wikipedia: [Pepe The Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog),
[Matt Furie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Furie)).
Neither Matt nor the vast majority of the internet views nor has any intent to view Pepe as more than a meme.
In his own words, Matt states

> "My Pepe philosophy is simple: 'Feels good man.'
It is based on the meaning of the word Pepe: 'To go Pepe'.
I find complete joy in physically, emotionally, and spiritually serving Pepe and his friends through comics.
Each comic is sacred, and the compassion of my readers transcends any differences, the pain, and fear of 'feeling good'."

Please also note that the word _fren_ is just a funny way of saying friend. (Know Your Meme: [fren](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fren)).

Last but not least: This website is to spread love & joy of Pepe memes.
It is truly a place for _onli frens_.
